<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Kaidi Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaidiyang/).

My research lies at the intersection of intelligent transportation systems, reinforcement learning, and control. I develop algorithms for traffic operations and decision/control of networked agents, with applications in autonomous driving (weaving-section coordination), UAV swarm prediction/control, and incident management.
